## New blog

May be you already noticed that my original blog on dynamicsusers.net (original URL was [https://www.dynamicsuser.net/nav/b/kine](https://www.dynamicsuser.net/nav/b/kine)) is gone. I am building new one from scratch. May be it is time to begin something new and cut off the Dynamics NAV history.

Because todays it is easy to use GitHub as a platform for the blog (and thus using git and vscode to "post" the articles), I decided to use [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) as the framework. Another side of this is, that 
my blog is "opensourced", thus you can see everything what is there and if you have some need to fix something, you can easilly post pullrequest.

I hope that you will find it worth to read it.

Enjoy it!
