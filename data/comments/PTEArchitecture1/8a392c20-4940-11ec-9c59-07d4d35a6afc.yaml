comment: "Hi.\r\n\"Performance (solvable)\"\r\nI think to many Extension on one elementar table (item / item ledger entry) is not solvable.\r\nThe Sql - join will decrease the access with every new Extension on one tabel.\r\n\r\nBeside your own extension you have external extension which extend perhabs also the elementar tables."
